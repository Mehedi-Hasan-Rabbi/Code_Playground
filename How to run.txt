1. Run XAMPP.
2. Creat a database called code_playground
3. Import given sql file into that database (File Locaton: Code_Playground\Database)
4. Copy and paste the Code_Playground folder to C:\xampp\htdocs
5. Go to a browser and type http://localhost/code_playground/




• In Code_Playground folder goto---> Code_Playground>main_web>IDE playground>compilers>c and cpp and cpp11

  path is C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin (In my computer case).

  IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PATH FOR C/C++ COMPILER THEN CHANGE THE PATH IN THE FILE(Code_Playground>main_web>IDE playground>compilers>c.php and cpp.php and   cpp11.php)


• There is a "web test.txt" file contian some demo code to check web playground is working or not. (Code_Playground\main_web\web playground)
  There is sample C/C++ demo code folder. (Code_Playground\main_web\IDE playground\code) 

• Admin: user name: admin, password: 12345
  If you want to add another admin than write MySQL code to create new admin or use XAMPP GUI. Use the bcrypt algorithm for password.
  Example: Password = 12345, than Enter "$2y$10$azd9hwV9elAXc598gv25P.hZ0fw8j2QlKbU7Q/ddOjuBg349SoQZm" which is the bcrypt of 12345. You can find bcrypt   hash generator online.

• User: user name: Mehedi Hasan, Password: 12345
